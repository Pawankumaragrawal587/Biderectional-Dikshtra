# Bidirectional-Dijkstra
Given a directed graph , a source node and the target node , this program will find shortest path between source and target nodes.
It is implementation of Bi-Directional Dijkstra's algorithm which can be very useful when graph is much dense such as 
graph which is formed by mutual friends or the peoples we follow on social media platforms.
